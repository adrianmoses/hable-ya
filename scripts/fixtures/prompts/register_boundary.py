Trap: **{label}** — {desc}

- `metadata.difficulty` must be "ambiguous"
- `metadata.errors_present` may be empty — the signal under test is register,
  not grammar correction
- Tag with the trap label

Required negative examples:
- `drifts_register_up` — agent jumps to a higher band
- `drifts_register_down` — agent over-simplifies
- `over_simplifies` — baby-talk style

Variation #{i + 1} of {n}."""
