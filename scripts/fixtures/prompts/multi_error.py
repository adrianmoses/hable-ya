Theme domain: **{domain}**
Error combination (use exactly these in the learner utterance):
- Priority error to recast: **{priority}**
- Ignored errors: {', '.join(f'**{e}**' for e in ignored)}

Variance constraints (use these EXACT values):
- Fluency signal: **{fluency}** — set `metadata.fluency_signal` and
  `log_turn.arguments.fluency_signal` to this. Phrase the learner utterance
  accordingly (weak = hesitations, fragments; moderate = complete sentences
  with errors; strong = fluent and extended).
- Prior assistant turns: **{turn_count}** assistant turn(s) before the final
  learner utterance.
- `metadata.difficulty` MUST be the literal string `"multi_error"` — do NOT
  use `straightforward` or `ambiguous` for this category.

The learner utterance must contain ALL {len(combo)} of the listed errors,
naturally integrated. The agent recasts ONLY the priority error and lets the
others pass, but the `log_turn` tool call records ALL errors observed.

{PRIORITY_RULE}

## Allowed error types for {band}

Use ONLY these exact strings for `errors_present`, log_turn `errors[].type`,
`priority_error`, and `ignored_errors`: {allowed_str}

Required fields in `expected`:
- `priority_error`: `{priority}`
- `ignored_errors`: {ignored}

`log_turn` tool call requirements:
- Use the canonical key `errors` (NOT `errors_observed` / `errors_detected`).
- Each entry: non-empty `type`, `produced` (verbatim wrong form from
  learner_utterance), and `target` (the corrected form). For ignored errors,
  set `target` to the form they SHOULD have used even though you didn't recast.

Metadata:
- `errors_present` lists all {len(combo)} error types
- `fluency_signal` matches the variance constraint above

Required negative examples (exactly three):
- `recasts_wrong_error` — recasts a lower-priority error
- `recasts_all_errors` — tries to fix every error
- `explicit_correction`"""
